# LogSplitter Industrial Control System

A distributed Arduino-based control system for industrial log splitting operations, featuring comprehensive monitoring, safety systems, and remote management capabilities.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The LogSplitter system consists of two coordinated Arduino UNO R4 WiFi units in a unified repository:

- **Controller** (root directory) - Main control unit with safety systems and relay management
- **[Monitor](monitor/)** - Remote monitoring with precision sensors, LCD display, and LED matrix heartbeat animation

Both units share unified logging infrastructure and communicate via MQTT for real-time coordination.

### Key Features of the Unified Architecture:
- **Clean Separation**: Controller handles industrial control, Monitor handles displays and sensing
- **Visual Feedback**: Monitor features 12x8 LED matrix with animated heartbeat (30-200 BPM)
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Unified logging, MQTT communication, and command interfaces
- **Coordinated Operation**: Both units work together for comprehensive system management

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Controller Setup
```bash
# Controller files are in the root directory
pio run --target upload
```
See [README_REFACTORED.md](README_REFACTORED.md) for detailed controller setup.

### 2. Monitor Setup
```bash
cd monitor/
pio run --target upload
```
See [monitor/README.md](monitor/README.md) for detailed monitor setup.

### 3. System Integration

### Safety & Monitoring
- **Pressure Safety Systems** - Multi-threshold monitoring with emergency stops
- **Hardware Watchdog** - Automatic recovery from system faults
- **Sensor Integration** - Temperature, pressure, and weight monitoring
- **LCD Status Display** - Real-time system information
