2. **Hydraulic Safety**: R1 and R2 immediately turn OFF, stopping all hydraulic movement
3. **Engine Safety**: R8 immediately turns OFF, disabling engine
4. **Buzzer Safety**: R7 immediately turns OFF, silencing pressure warning buzzer
5. **System Lock**: All relays remain OFF until manual system reset
6. **Status Logging**: Emergency stop event logged with relay states

#### Limit Switch Integration
- **Extend Limit (Pin 6)**: Automatically sends `R1 OFF` when limit reached during extend operation
- **Retract Limit (Pin 7)**: Automatically sends `R2 OFF` when limit reached during retract operation
- **Override Protection**: Manual override flag prevents accidental relay activation during limit conditions

#### Pressure Safety Integration
- **Over-Pressure Warning**: R7 buzzer activates when pressure exceeds warning threshold (90% of max)
- **10-Second Warning Period**: Buzzer provides 10-second warning before automatic system shutdown
- **Over-Pressure Shutdown**: Automatically disables R1/R2 when pressure exceeds safety limits after warning period
- **Under-Pressure**: Prevents hydraulic operation when insufficient pressure detected
- **Pressure Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with relay control integration
- **Buzzer Reset**: R7 automatically turns OFF when pressure drops below warning threshold

### Command Examples

> relay R1 ON
relay R1 ON

# Manual hydraulic retract  
> relay R2 ON
relay R2 ON

ALL RELAYS OFF
```

#### Status Monitoring
```bash
# Check relay status
> show
Relays: R1=OFF(EXTEND) R2=OFF(RETRACT) R3=OFF R4=OFF R5=OFF R6=OFF R7=OFF(BUZZER) R8=OFF(ENGINE)

## Safety System Integration

### Critical Input Monitoring
The safety system continuously monitors these inputs with high priority:

1. **Emergency Stop (Pin 12)** - Highest priority
2. **Pressure Sensors (A1, A5)** - Over-pressure protection
3. **Limit Switches (Pins 6, 7)** - Over-travel protection

### Emergency Stop Behavior
When E-Stop is activated (Pin 12 goes LOW):
1. **Immediate Response**: All relays turn OFF within 10ms
2. **Sequence Abort**: Current hydraulic sequence immediately terminated
3. **Safety Lock**: System enters EMERGENCY_STOP state
4. **Manual Reset**: E-Stop must be released and system manually restarted
5. **Status Indication**: LED fast blink pattern
6. **Logging**: E-Stop event logged with timestamp

### Manual Operation Safety
The system provides automatic protection during manual hydraulic operations:

#### Extend Limit Safety (Pin 6)
- **Trigger**: When extend limit switch (Pin 6) activates during manual operation
- **Action**: Automatically turns OFF extend relay (R1) to prevent over-travel
- **Logging**: "SAFETY: Extend operation stopped - limit switch reached"
- **Override**: Uses manual override flag to ensure operation during safety conditions

#### Retract Limit Safety (Pin 7)
- **Trigger**: When retract limit switch (Pin 7) activates during manual operation
- **Action**: Automatically turns OFF retract relay (R2) to prevent over-travel
- **Logging**: "SAFETY: Retract operation stopped - limit switch reached"
- **Override**: Uses manual override flag to ensure operation during safety conditions

#### Safety Operation Flow
```
Manual Command: relay R1 ON     # User starts extend
System Response: relay R1 ON    # Relay activates
[Hydraulic cylinder extends...]
Limit Reached: Pin 6 ACTIVE     # Limit switch triggers
Safety Action: R1 OFF           # Automatic relay shutdown
User Feedback: "SAFETY: Extend operation stopped - limit switch reached"
```

### Input Prioritization
1. **Emergency Stop** - Overrides all other inputs
2. **Limit Switches** - Override sequence commands and stop manual operations
3. **Pressure Sensors** - Trigger safety shutdowns
4. **Splitter Operator Signal** - Communication between operators
5. **Network Commands** - Lowest priority, fail-safe

> error ack 0x04    # Replace 0x04 with your actual error code

# After acknowledgment, mill lamp should change to SLOW BLINK
# If problem is fixed, clear the error:
> error clear       # Clears all errors - mill lamp should turn OFF
```

---

### SECTION B: Multiple Error Diagnosis (SLOW BLINK)

**Step B1: List All Active Errors**
```bash
> error list
# Expected output: Multiple errors like "0x04:Pressure sensor, 0x08:(ACK)Network failed"
# Note: (ACK) means error is acknowledged but still active
```

**Step B2: Prioritize Critical Issues**
1. **Address hardware faults first** (0x01, 0x20, 0x40)
2. **Check operational sensors** (0x04, 0x80) 
3. **Network issues are lowest priority** (0x08)

**Step B3: Sequential Resolution**
```bash
# Acknowledge non-critical errors to continue operations:
> error ack 0x08    # Network issues
> error ack 0x04    # Sensor warnings (if hydraulics still work)

# Test basic functionality:
> relay R1 ON       # Test extend relay
> relay R1 OFF
> relay R2 ON       # Test retract relay  
> relay R2 OFF

# If hydraulics work, you can continue operating while planning maintenance
```

### SECTION C: Critical Error Diagnosis (FAST BLINK)

**⚠️ WARNING: FAST BLINK indicates critical system failure requiring immediate attention**

**Step C1: Emergency Status Check**
```bash
> show
# Look for critical error indicators in system status
```

**Step C2: Critical Error Codes**
| Code | Critical Issue | Immediate Action |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| 0x01 | EEPROM CRC failure | **STOP OPERATIONS** - Restart controller |
| 0x20 | Memory allocation failure | **STOP OPERATIONS** - Power cycle system |
| 0x40 | Hardware fault detected | **STOP OPERATIONS** - Check all connections |

**Step C3: Emergency Actions**
```bash
# DO NOT CONTINUE OPERATIONS - These steps are for safe shutdown only:

# 1. Stop all hydraulic operations immediately:
> relay ALL OFF

# 2. Check if manual controls still work:
> pins              # Verify pin states

# 3. Document the error for maintenance:
> error list        # Record all error codes

# 4. Restart the controller:
> reset             # Or power cycle the entire system
```

**Step C4: Post-Restart Verification**
```bash
# After controller restart, verify mill lamp is OFF:
> show              # Should show errors=0 led=OFF

# If mill lamp is still blinking after restart:
# - Contact maintenance personnel immediately
# - Do not resume operations
# - Check hardware connections and power supply
```

### Emergency Command Reference

**Quick Status Commands**
```bash
> show              # Complete system status including mill lamp
> error list        # List all active errors
> pins              # Check all pin states
> relay status      # Check all relay states
```

**Emergency Control Commands**
```bash
> relay ALL OFF     # Emergency stop all relays
> error ack 0x##    # Acknowledge specific error (replace ## with code)
> error clear       # Clear all errors (use only after fixing issues)
> reset             # Restart controller (for critical errors)
```

**Safety Override Commands** *(Use only when absolutely necessary)*
```bash
> relay R1 ON       # Manual extend (emergency pressure relief)
> relay R2 ON       # Manual retract (emergency positioning)
> relay R8 OFF      # Emergency engine stop override
```

### Mill Lamp Hardware Troubleshooting

**If Mill Lamp Doesn't Light Despite Error Commands:**

1. **Check Physical LED Connection**
   ```bash
   > set pin 9 ON      # Force pin 9 HIGH - LED should light
   > set pin 9 OFF     # Force pin 9 LOW - LED should turn off
   ```

2. **Verify Pin Configuration**
   ```bash
   > pins              # Check Pin 9 shows OUTPUT mode
   ```

3. **Test Error System**
   ```bash
   > debug ON          # Enable detailed diagnostics
   > error test        # Generate test error (if available)
   ```

**If Commands Don't Work:**
- Check Serial/USB connection
- Verify controller power (Pin 13 LED should be on)
- Try different terminal program
- Check baud rate: 115200

### ⚠️ SAFETY REMINDER

**The mill lamp operates INDEPENDENTLY of critical safety systems:**
- Emergency Stop (Pin 12) still works even with mill lamp errors
- Limit switches (Pins 6,7) still provide safety protection  
- Manual pressure relief via relay commands remains available
- Mill lamp errors indicate maintenance needs, not immediate danger

**When in doubt: Use Emergency Stop (Pin 12) and contact maintenance**
